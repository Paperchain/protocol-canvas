# Protocol Canvas
Protocol canvas is a means to map primitives with actors within a decentralized protocol. Think Lean Business Canvas but for Decentralized Systems and fully open source.

## Overview
Designing decentralized systems brings into context some novel areas of focus like crypto-economics, token design, decentralized protocol architecture, token engineering etc. In addition, there are a lack tools for entrepreneurs, engineers, product managers & designers to express and optimize their protocol designs. 

The Protocol Canvas is a tool for ‘Protocol Designers’ to help design a new decentralized system. The canvas can also be used to deconstruct existing decentralized systems to identify the gaps and to optimize its design. **Whitepapers** can efficiently leverage this canvas to clearly communicate their protocol design.

## Using The Canvas
Mechanism design is a sub-discipline of economics dedicated to studying how to design protocols that incentivize rational actors to behave in socially desirable ways.

While in game theory, we take the game as a given and analyze its outcomes according to players’ utilities, mechanism design allows one to start by defining desirable outcomes and work backwards to create a game that incentivizes players towards those outcomes.

The principle of mechanism design is a driving factor in approaching the design of decentralized protocols. 

## Objectives & Decentralized Protocol Primitives
The primary objective being to capture the participating network actors' mappings to the system's decentralized protocol primitives (DPPs). 

- Identify the network **Actors** & their roles 
- List what their top 'value adds' are to the network to capture their **Desired Behaviours**
- Create **Incentives** in place to extract the actors' desired bevaiours
- Lay out deterministic and probabilistic outcomes for pre-defined rulesets
- Identify points of failure as **Risk Factors** associated with each actor
- Explore what **Governance** measures ( ex: staking & slashing ) can be applied to mitigate risks
- Map out what Risks vs Rewards are

Some examples for Actors are 
- Miners (Ethereum)
- Makers & Takers (0x)
- Reporter (Augur)
- Curator (TCRs)

Some examples for DPPs are
- Desired behaviours
- Incentives
- Risk Factors
- Rewards
- Goveranance 
- Security 
- Trust
- Points of failure

Incentives can be refferred to activies such as block rewards, earning tokens etc. 
Staking & Slashing can be considered as governance measures.

As many canvases are built and the design mapped out, some interesting observation start forming
- dApps center around designs that risk vs reward for actors while protocol identify risks & mitigate them through network incentives
- protocols work on commitment in the future based on performance in the past
- risk <> reward structures keep all actors on edge and accountable
- block rewards are ideal for proven resource contribution

## Putting it all together
What we end with is mapping all of this is as a matrix - the Protocol Canvas or the Protocol Matrix ( see below )

## Contributions
The mission here is to help individuals and organizations capture their design in standardized way and to contribute towards the new discipline of Token Engineering. 

Looking for contrbutors to submit their protocol designed using the matrix, add new DPPs etc. 
- Fork the repo
- Use the template from TEMPLATE.md
- Create a new file name named <protocol-name>.md under the 'canvases' folder.
- Submit a PR!
